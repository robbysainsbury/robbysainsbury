### About Me :

- I'm currently pursuing a master's in Biomedical Informatics from the University of Utah. I also have a B.S. in Statistics from Brigham Young University and experience with data managment and analysis. I enjoy using data science and statistical analysis to solve important problems in omics research, enviornmental science, and public health.  
- I'm currently working as a research associate in the Kendell Clement Lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the Univeristy of Utah. My research and schooling focus on single cell multi-omics studies of cancer.
- In the past I worked as a data manager and research assistant with the Ben Abbott Lab of Ecosystem Ecology at BYU.
